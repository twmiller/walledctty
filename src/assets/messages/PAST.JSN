    "Message":"This is the nostalgia-based message area, so if you're inclined to reminisce\nabout the past, this is the place to do it. This is also the place you can\npost things like, \"Connected from my Commodore 64!!!!11\", if you must.\nHonestly, though, it's far more interesting to hear about what your Commodore\n64 means to you and\\/or and why you took the time and effort to get it back\non-line.\n\nI could simply write, \"This BBS is hosted on a 386!!!11,\" which is both true\nand cool. But more than that, it's significant to me because the first\ncomputer I ever had that was mine-and-mine-alone was a 386. That machine was\na 16 MHz SX, with 4 MB of RAM and an 80 MB HDD.\n\nThis BBS machine is a 40 MHz DX with 32 MB of RAM and a 4 GB HDD.  It's\nnot the machine I had, but the machine I wanted.  (When I got the SX in the\nlate 80s, the 80 MB drive was fairly respectable, and 4 GB drives didn't\nreally come out until the 386 was long retired.)\n\nI think I squeezed more enjoyment out of that 386SX than any other computer\nI've owned, and I've owned *a lot* of computers, so that's saying something.\nI not only played most of the classic DOS games from the late 80s\\/early 90s\non that machine, but I also learned how to program and configured a lot of \nBBS\nsoftware on it back in the day. It's been fun revisiting a lot of that\nsoftware, especially T.A.G., the BBS software this board uses.\n\nIt's a testament to how foundational that 386SX was in my 'computer history'\nthat while I remember it, I have no memory of the computer that replaced\nit, or really any of the computers that followed it.\n\nLumpy the 386, which is the name I've affectionately given the BBS machine,\nis a simple beige clone. It's probably one of the more pedestrian computers\nin my 'vintage computer collection'. It's also probably my favorite.\n\n"

    "Subject":"OS/2 Revisited",
    "Message":"The first PC I used was a 12 MHz 80286 clone, running MS-DOS 3.30. This would\nhave been sometime in the mid-eighties. At some point, my dad purchased a \ncopy\nof DesqView and QRAM. On the 286, DesqView enabled task-switching, which gave\nyou the ability to start a word processor window and then swap it out for\nQuickBASIC or some other task you were working on. It worked reasonably well,\nthough not as well as it would on the 386SX that I'd buy for myself my senior\nyear of high school.\n\nOn that machine, with a 16 MHz processor and a whopping 4 MB of RAM, DesqView\nactually allowed the tasks in the background to keep running along at a\nreasonable clip. It also opened up the ability to actually run three or four\ntasks with a minimal performance hit. The first BBS system I ever set up ran\nunder DesqView, not because I was running a multinode setup, but because I\nonly owned one computer and I wanted to use it while the board was up.\n\nWhile this worked, users could always tell when I was using the computer\nfor something in the background while they were connected to the board.\nCharacters would come in bursts, and a 2400 baud connection would feel\nsomewhat closer to 1200 baud. I remember one of my BBS friends telling me\nthat they always knew when my girlfriend was visiting because the board was\nactually usable.\n\nIn 1992 I moved away from DesqView with the release of OS\\/2 version 2.0. This\nwas a full operating system, not a shell that was forced to deal with the\nlimitations of the base MS-DOS operating system. Background tasks, even ones\nwhich were DOS programs, ran *much* smoother. To the extent that there was\ndelay, it was minimal enough that you'd never notice it on a 2400 baud\nconnection.\n\nI remember being *amazed* that you could format a disk and still use the\ncomputer for other things. I have a distinct memory of installing a pirated\n(avast, ye lubbers!) copy of Borland C++ that had been downloaded as a\ncollection of zipped up diskette images. I only had a few spare diskettes,\nso I formatted a disk, copied the first install image onto it, and then\nopened a new window to start the install. When it asked for the next disk,\nI switched back to the first window, reformatted the same diskette, and\ncopied the next image to the floppy. Rinse and repeat through a dozen or so\ndiskette images until the software was installed.\n\nI know that anyone who used an Amiga back in the day is scoffing at the\nabove, but on the PC side, this was the first true multi-tasking experience I\nhad encountered that actually felt like you were dealing with a fully\nfunctional computer. As much as value as I got out of DesqView, it was and\nhas always felt like something of a compromise.\n\nI feel like I stuck with OS\\/2 to the bitter end, although I know that there\nwere fanatics who used it *long* after I had jumped ship for combination of\nWindows 98 on a desktop 486, and Slackware on a small server I had set up on\na 'retired' 386. I still feel a pang of regret about IBM having 'lost' the\nOS wars to Microsoft. In retrospect, I have to admit that while OS\\/2 excels\nin performance, its presentation and ease-of-use leave something to be\ndesired. I won't say it's a complete hassle, but it's definitely not for the\nfaint of heart.\n\n"
