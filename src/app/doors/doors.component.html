Although various utility doors exist, including those with echo-message base handling (for systems without the feature built-in) and file utilities, the primary purpose of doors is to provide access to games! WalledCTTY currently offers a selection of games for its users to enjoy through BBS Doors. While almost all of the doors support ANSI/ASCII by default, some also provide the user with the option to use specific external clients that offer EGA or VGA graphics while playing the game.</p>
