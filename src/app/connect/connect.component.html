            <h1 class="page-header">"Modern" Telnet Connections</h1>
            <p>To connect to WalledCTTY BBS using a modern computer, you'll need to install a telnet client for your given computer and telnet to:
            bbs.walledctty.com on port 1989. I highly recommend using something with ANSI support for the best experience. I believe <a href="https://syncterm.bbsdev.net" target="_blank" class="secondary-link">SyncTerm</a> is available for Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X, and FreeBSD and works really well. On Windows and Linux machines, <a href="http://mysticbbs.com/downloads.html" target="_blank" class="secondary-link">Netrunner</a> is another option.
            On macOS, there's also <a href="https://muffinterm.app" target="_blank" class="secondary-link">MuffinTerm</a>, which I've used for testing the board, and it also works very well. If you want a retro feel, you even have the option to emulate CRTs in MuffinTerm. :D</p>
            <h1 class="page-header">Node 1 Modem Connection</h1>
            <p>For users inside of the US, one node is connected to an actual modem. The modem is an external U.S. Robotics 56k v.92 answering calls at 1 (970) 449-0767.  This is completely untested though. I have tried the modem itself on *other* dial-up boards that still exist, though, and was able to connect with success. I've found that faster modems (with error correction) actually tend to work better on VOIP than slower modems without. If you try to dial-in and it doesn't work, log-in via telnet and let me know! I'll try to fix it! (Note to self: add contact form to webpage.)</p>
            <h1 class="page-header">"Retro" Terminals on Modern Hardware</h1>
            <p><span class="blink">Coming Soon!</span> It's also possible to use a period appropriate MS-DOS terminal application inside DOSBox using its built-in serial-to-internet capabilities. I haven't done this, but I've read about it. I will investigate and replace this text with appropriate instructions when time allows. This will also allow you to use graphical frontend software for a number of the doors the system hosts.</p>
            <h1 class="page-header">Vintage PCs</h1>
            <p><span class="blink">Coming Soon!</span> I'll start logging onto the board using vintage hardware and will document my experiences here. I'll also provide instructions on how to connect to the board using vintage hardware. I've been putting this off because up until this point the board development has largely focused on 80x25 characters using ANSI/ASCII, rather than the 40 character screen width that many vintage computers require.</p>
