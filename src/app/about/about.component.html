            <p>WalledCTTY is powered by a 40 MHz <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am386" target="_blank">AMD 80386</a> processor, which was the fastest 386 available at the time of its release, capable of handling complex tasks and multitasking processes. The <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Inc." target="_blank">Shuttle</a> HOT-307 motherboard, with its 512k cache, is also a relatively high-performance component from its time. It's maxed out at 32 MB of memory which would have been a substantial amount of memory in its day. Two 500 GB hard drives offer ample storage space, both for the BBS and related software, and also for backups. The System also includes an <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_Mach_series" target="_blank">ATI Mach 8</a> video card which was a decent graphics card when it was new, and offers excellent software support. Finally, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Com_3c509" class="secondary-link" target="_blank">3COM Etherlink III</a> network card provides reliable connectivity to the wider network, not only allowing users to connect to the system via telnet, but also paving the way to allow the BBS to share some of its files with this website. Lastly, there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16550_UART" class="secondary-link" target="_blank">16550</a> serial port card that's connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USRobotics" target="_blank" class="secondary-link">U.S. Robotics</a> v.92 56k external modem.</p>
            <h1 class="page-header">Software</h1>
            <p>The operating system running on the WalledCTTY BBS server is IBM's <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2" target="_blank">OS/2 Warp 3 Connect</a>. This is the last version of OS/2 that will run on the 80386 family of processors, and includes a modern enough <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol/Internet_Protocol" target="_blank">TCP/IP</a> stack that we can achieve the connectivity we need to get into and out of the system. In conjunction with the TCP/IP stack, we're using Ray Gwinn's fantastic <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIO_(software)" target="_blank">SIO comm drivers</a> and virtual modems. The BBS software we're using is <a class="secondary-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAG_(BBS)" target="_blank">T.A.G. 2.7d2</a>, which was the last release of the T.A.G. software. T.A.G. is a very powerful BBS software package, and is capable of handling a large number of users and a large number of messages. It's also very customizable, and we've made a number of changes to the software to make it more suitable for our purposes. We've also added a number of <a class="secondary-link" href="/doors">doors</a> to the system, including many popular games from the early to mid 1990s.</p>
